				<h4>“Welcome to ePASS” Video</h4>
				<p>As a reminder, the new “Welcome to ePASS” video is now available on the NCDHHS website. This video introduces North Carolinians to the NC ePASS user experience and provides instruction on how applicants can establish an account, navigate the website, and take advantage of features designed to help them manage their benefits. If your county includes the previous ePASS video on your county’s website, please make sure that it is updated with the new “Welcome to ePASS” video. The video can be found here:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsjgM6fy2Ho">ePass</a><br>
				If you have any questions please contact your P14.2 County Readiness Liaison.</p>

		<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">For the safety of staff and the community, Tyrrell County Department of Social Services(TCDSS) has adjusted some operational procedures. The face-to-face requirements for many Social Services’ programs have been waived. Also, Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) cases are being automatically extended by the State DSS for 6-12 months, depending on the current certification period. Medicaid cases are NOT being terminated unless a client moves out of state or requests that the Medicaid be terminated. If you have had any changes, including income changes, please contact your TCDSS worker by phone to update. NC residents in need, and not currently receiving Medicaid or FNS benefits, can apply on ePASS.nc.gov or by completing a mail-in application. Applications are available at the agency or one can be mailed to you. All procedures are subject to change at any time, depending on the direction of our County Leaders and The Department of Health and Human Services. Please contact TCDSS at 252-796-3421 with any questions or to speak with a staff member.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">This past winter, Tyrrell County Department of Social Services (TCDSS) assisted over 70 households with an elderly person to receive heating assistance through the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP).  LIEAP is a 100% federally funded program.  Those same LIEAP approved households can expect to receive a one-time supplement payment paid directly to the household’s primary heating vendor.  The one-time supplements are a result of excess LIEAP funds that were not utilized in NC during the LIEAP season.  The supplement amounts will be based on household size and approved LIEAP benefit amounts.  A notice will be mailed from DHHS to households informing them of the supplement payment.  There is NO application process and only approved LIEAP households from this past winter will receive the automatic supplement.  Clients can expect their primary heating vendor to receive and process the payment or credit by June.  Please wait until mid-June to reach out to Dominion, Crossroads, Ferrell or Amerigas to verify payment or credit.</blockquote>
